# Radar-Project
🔍 Description: This project is a radar system using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) mounted on a servo motor to scan a restricted area. If an object is detected within 50 cm, a buzzer sounds, and an LED turns on as an alert. The system can be extended to send notifications using an ESP8266/ESP32.
